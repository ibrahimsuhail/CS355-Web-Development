# CS355-Web-Development
My term project from my Web Development class

This website is still a work in progress. 
I will upload the code once it's finished. 
In the meantime, you can still visit the website at https://venus.cs.qc.cuny.edu/~suib1362/cs355/

The website is a student/teacher platform similar to tophat.com
Teachers can create questions inside question sets, which are then available to students.
Once a student completes a question set, the teacher can view that student's score.

Technologies used: html, css, javascript, php, mysql database
